# Project Explanation

This project, titled "My Mails", is a web application aimed at managing and displaying messages. It comprises two primary components: the main mailbox interface and a UI kit for developers.

## Main Mailbox Interface
The main mailbox interface is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a header, two content sections (left and right) for displaying messages, and a footer. Users can perform various actions such as adding new messages, searching for specific messages, and deleting messages. The layout is created using CSS Grid, ensuring a responsive design across different screen sizes.

### HTML Structure:
- The header contains a logo and a search input field.
- The left content section allows users to add new messages.
- The right content section displays existing messages.
- The footer provides information about the project.

### CSS Styling:
- The CSS file defines the layout, colors, and styles for different elements.
- It uses flexbox for aligning elements within the header, footer, and message rows.
- Specific classes are used for styling elements such as avatars, buttons, and inputs.

### JavaScript Functionality:
- JavaScript is used to handle dynamic interactions within the interface.
- It dynamically updates the message count and displays the current date in the footer.
- Event listeners are added to handle actions such as adding messages, deleting messages, and searching for messages.

## UI Kit
The UI kit provides a collection of reusable components for developers. It includes examples of typography, images, buttons, and inputs styled according to the project's theme. Developers can integrate these components into their projects to maintain consistency and accelerate development.

### Components Included:
- Typography: Example text styles for headers and paragraphs.
- Images: Sample images including logos and avatars.
- Buttons & Inputs: Styled buttons for actions like searching and deleting messages.
